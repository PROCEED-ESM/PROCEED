PROCEED Computational Resources
===============================

* `NCAR-Wyoming Supercomputing Center (NWSC) <https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/ncar-wyoming-supercomputing-center>`_: PROCEED uses resources from NWSC's Derecho supercomputing system to run our computationally-intensive PPEs and its Casper supercomputing system to process PPE output and perform analysis.
* `University of Wyoming Advanced Research Computing Center (ARCC) <https://www.uwyo.edu/arcc/index.html>`_: PROCEED uses additional resources from the ARCC MedicineBow Cluster to provide storage that supports running and processing the PPE output.
* `University of Wyoming School of Computing <https://www.uwyo.edu/soc/index.html>`_: The School of Computing provides additional support for developing, running, and processing our PPEs.
