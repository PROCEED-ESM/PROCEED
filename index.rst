*PPE Regression Optimization Center for ESM Evaluation and Development*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Earth System Models (**ESMs**) need to be able to predict environmental change decades into the future at a global scale, but many of the processes that set global climate operate at a scale of micrometers and seconds, like aerosols, clouds, and precipitation. To tackle this problem we have to develop parameterizations that allow our global scale models to represent these phenomena. Department of Energy is supporting us to work with researchers at Pacific Northwest National Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, and with the UW School of Computing and Caulton Research Group to come up with a development framework for E3SM and challenge model variants with high-quality observations from DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (**ARM**) sites.

The goal of PROCEED is to become a key partner in Earth System Model (**ESM**) development in the United States through the creation of
a unique observationally-driven model evaluation and development framework.  
We base PROCEED around two pillars: 
 - Create a perturbed physics ensemble (**PPE**) approach to systematically evaluate and constrain ESMs;
 - Create a large eddy simulation methodology to bridge process-scale in situ observations to resolution of global models.
